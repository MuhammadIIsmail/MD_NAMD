to generate a movie (in case ptn/ligand passed the pbc)

1. upload psf and dcd
2. change representations to new cartoon and licorice
3. open tk console
4. paste the following commnds:

########################################################################################
pbc wrap -compound fragment -center com -centersel "<enter your selection>: the chain(s) or molecule(s) you want to 
keep at the center of the box" -sel "<enter your selection>: the chain(s) or molecule(s) you want to keep at the 
center of the box + any other molecule(s) of interest" -all

Note: Usually water molecules and ions are excluded from the "-centersel" because of their high rate of diffusion 
(mobility). Also, "-sel" flag is optional, however if you have a large (say > 100000 atoms) system with many water 
molecules and ions or other large miscellaneous molecules of lesser relevance, it would speed up the wrapping process.

As mentioned earlier, it is very important to give sufficient padding with water molecules at the start of the 
simulation; to account for the molecular fluctuations within the complex of interest during the simulation period.

######################################################################################
pbc wrap -centersel "protein" -center com -compound fragment -sel "protein or resname LIG" -all
#################################################################
pbc wrap -centersel "all" -center com -compound residue -all 
#################################################################

pbc join connected -now
pbc join residue -now
pbc unwrap -sel "not waters" -all

in some cases you may need to add: 

pbc wrap -center com -centersel "not waters" -compound residue -all

in some cases:

# join all bonds of long polymer chain molecules
pbc join fragment -bondlist

5. extensions > analysis > RMSD visualizer tool
6. select backbone, align
7. display > reset view

8. extensions > analysis > RMSD trajectory tool

9. type segname B instead of protein
10. click RMSD
11. File > save data
12. save as 'txt' file
13. open it in gedit
14. remove any words. replace NA with 0.000. remove the empty line at the end of the file.
15. take screenshot of 'RMSD trajectory tool' window for RMSD average, sd, min, max.
