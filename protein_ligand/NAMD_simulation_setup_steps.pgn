# A segment called A is created, containing all atoms from 3zfxp.pdb.The segment command also adds hydrogen atoms.

#Coordinates are read from 3zfxp.pdb and residue and atom names are matched. Old segment labels will be overridden with the new segment label “A"

#Coordinates of missing atoms (like hydrogens) are guessed based on residue definitions from the topology file.

#A new pdb file with the complete coordinates of all atoms, including hydrogens, is written.

#call solvate package for vmd.

package require solvate
#The package require solvate command loads the solvate package, so that VMD will be able to call it.

solvate complex.psf complex.pdb -t 14 -o complex_wb


# The solvate package will put your protein (described in complex.psf and complex.pdb)
# in a box of water. The -t option creates the water box dimensions such that
# there is a layer of water 7Å in each direction from the atom with the largest
# coordinate in that direction. The -o option creates the output files complex_wb.pdb
# and complex_wb.psf for ubiquitin with the water box. You will also obtain the files
# combine.pdb and combine.psf which may be eliminated. They are intermediate files 
# used by the solvate program to transport information into VMD.
